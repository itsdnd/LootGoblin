##### About
This has been a pet project of mine for a few months. The group that I play D&D with enjoys both extravagant stories, great roleplay, and also all of the fun of looting as much as we can. Coming up with loot for the various creatures and objects that we interacted with can often be very time consuming, and we wanted a way to automate the process and allow it a sense of randomness. This program is geered towards DMs who want to provide their players with a treasure trove of available items in many different categories. Hopefully this program allows any of you DMs or other loot goblins out there the ability to dive into a world of treasure that can be as specific or random as you would like it to be.
